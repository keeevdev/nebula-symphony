# Nebula Symphony – VS Code Theme

Nebula Symphony is a collection of themes for Visual Studio Code inspired by the aesthetics of space and the beauty of a visual symphony. Designed to offer an immersive experience and optimal readability, our themes combine elegance and functionality to suit various work environments.

## Included Themes
- **Nebula Symphony Dark:**  
  A dark theme ideal for low-light environments, reducing eye strain and improving contrast during long coding sessions.
- **Nebula Symphony Light:**  
  A light theme designed for bright environments, offering a vibrant and fresh experience without compromising readability.

## Key Features

- **Universe-Inspired Design:**  
  Every color and tone is carefully selected to evoke the vastness of space and the harmony of a symphony, creating a unique visual atmosphere.

- **Advanced Semantic Highlighting:**  
  - Supports semantic highlighting that improves the differentiation of code elements according to their role (e.g., Dart annotations, constants, variables, etc.).  
  - Enables faster identification of structures and patterns across various languages.

- **Comprehensive Token Colors Coverage:**  
  - Detailed configurations to highlight different aspects of your code: variables, functions, comments, operators, strings, numbers, and more.  
  - Compatible with multiple languages such as Dart, Python, JavaScript, Rust, Java, PHP, C++, and many others, ensuring a consistent experience across your projects.

- **Customized Interface Colors:**  
  - Defines the appearance of each Visual Studio Code component, including the activity bar, editor, terminal, sidebar, and other essential elements.  
  - Provides seamless integration so that the entire environment looks uniform and stylish, in line with the theme concept.

- **Developer-Centric Visual Optimization:**  
  - Carefully chosen contrasts and color palettes that facilitate reading and focus even in low-light conditions.  
  - Adjustable settings allow you to further personalize your experience by editing the `semanticTokenColors`, `tokenColors`, and other interface elements.
